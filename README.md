# Joda üññ == JRuby + Roda

And here it is üéâ My template for Ruby's notorious web router [Roda](https://roda.jeremyevans.net) - running on the JVM ([JRuby](https://www.jruby.org))! üåã

Start the server with `$ rackup`, then benchmark (see below) as unscientifically as possible (but easy as pie), using [HTTPie](https://httpie.io):

`$ time http :9292/jsondata >/dev/null`  
sucks 25mb from your server üßõ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

## Why though?

I cannot really say why JRuby intriqued me, since I fell in love with Ruby.  
But, at least for me, JRuby isn't especially beginner friendly. üò¨  
Something didn't work. Very tough to google.  
Java docs?! Java ecosystem?! They do what? How on earth? Cheesus ... ü§¢

## This repository is aimed at

- curious Rubyists, struggling to find a use case of getting something up with [JRuby](https://www.jruby.org)
- those who want get hold of JRuby, without the suspicious feeling that Rails takes care of everything behind the curtains (it's why we love you, Rails, you know that! üòò)
- People curious of [Roda](https://roda.jeremyevans.net)
- PORO lovers
- [Rack](https://github.com/rack/rack) fanboys
- [Sinatra](https://sinatrarb.com) / [Fastify](https://www.fastify.io) / [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com) / [Gin](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin)
- Java people / JVM users ‚òïÔ∏è
- those on a journey, they don't know, they are on: Ruby ‚û° JRuby ‚û° [Clojure](https://clojure.org/guides/getting_started) ‚òÆÔ∏è

## Run

if one of you gets this going on another OS, please submit a PR with some handy notes ‚úåÔ∏è

### Docker

- `$ docker build . -t joda`
- `$ docker run --rm -it -p9292:9292 joda`

### MacOS and asdf

please, see the docs of your [asdf-vm](https://asdf-vm.com) java plugin ([docs of the default java plugin üìñ](https://github.com/halcyon/asdf-java#java_home)). It's about JRuby having Java in it's PATH.

Then fire the following commands:

- `$ asdf install java microsoft-17.35.1`
- `$ asdf reshim`
- `$ asdf install ruby jruby-9.3.6.0`
- `$ bundle install -j4`
- `$ jruby -S rackup`

## Profiling JRuby

`$ jruby --profile.graph -S rackup`

## JVM Options

This is how you could use it for production:
`$ jruby -J-Xmx512m --server -S rackup -E production`

- minimum and maximum Java heap size to 512 MB
- optimization for server ON
- runs Rack in production mode

or:

`$ jruby -J-Xms2g -J-Xmx2g --server -J-Djruby.thread.pool.enabled=true -S rackup -E production`

## Benchmarks ü•ºüß™üíª

**FIRST OF ALL** the JVM had some requests before the benchs to warm up a little  
**BUT** let's be honest the server wasn't fresh and had already other stuff to do  
**AND** had 2 just cores (but 8 gigs of RAM üòÖ)
**AND** it's for sure I missed an opportunity for tweaking something  
**BECAUSE** the JVM still is completely new to me at this point  
**SO** this is worthless, but some just need the numbers

well, enough whining...

## Thought Section

Entering this fancy new rabbit hole, here's what didn't work, or may well be served with butter in the future

#### Database

- H2 database will crash when load testing these routes and throw horrifying errors, I propose you use Postgres/MySQL/AnyOtherProperDB for mimicking "real-life" server simulation

#### Roda

there's so much beauty in Roda, so it would be nice to showcase more of it.

I suggest you stumble through the Website

- [Roda's Website](https://roda.jeremyevans.net)
- Federico's and [Avdi](https://avdi.codes)'s Book: [Mastering Roda](https://fiachetti.gitlab.io/mastering-roda/)
- [Jeremy Evans' Code Lair](https://code.jeremyevans.net/ruby.html) (sequel, rodauth, and many more)
